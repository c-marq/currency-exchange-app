## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Netlify

**Issue:** Build command fails
**Solution:** 
- Check Node version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check build logs for specific errors

### 404 Errors on Routes

**Issue:** Refreshing page shows 404
**Solution:**
- Verify `netlify.toml` has redirect rules
- Check `public/_redirects` file exists
- Ensure `dist` folder is published

### API Calls Fail

**Issue:** Exchange rates don't load
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify Frankfurter API is accessible: https://api.frankfurter.app/latest
- Check network tab in DevTools

### Assets Not Loading

**Issue:** Favicon or other assets missing
**Solution:**
- Verify files are in `public/` folder
- Check build output includes assets
- Clear browser cache

## Environment Variables

This project doesn't require any environment variables as it uses the free Frankfurter API.

If you need to add environment variables in the future:
1. Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
2. Add key-value pairs
3. Redeploy the site

## Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub, Netlify will automatically:
- Deploy on every push to `main` branch
- Create deploy previews for pull requests
- Provide deploy logs and rollback options

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

1. Go to Site settings â†’ Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions
5. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
6. Netlify will auto-provision SSL certificate

## Monitoring

### Netlify Analytics (Optional Paid Feature)
- Real-time visitor stats
- Bandwidth usage
- Top pages

### Free Monitoring:
- Deploy logs: Site â†’ Deploys
- Function logs: Site â†’ Functions (if using)
- Build logs: Click on any deploy

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:
1. Go to Deploys tab
2. Find a previous working deploy
